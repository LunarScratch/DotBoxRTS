This is the GIT for the in development game DotBoxRTS (name to be determined)

DotBoxRTS takes the elements from the game dots and boxes, and applies it to an RTS scenario with unit production and teams.
The objective is to create boxes using lines to build on. The more boxes you own, the more area you have to build facilities that can be used to generate resources, create units, etc.
